        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>My name is <strong>Hailey Arroyo.</strong> A few things about me is that I transferred to a different highschool in my junior year. I first started out at <i>North Providence Highschool</i> and then transferred to <i>Johnston Senior Highschool</i> the middle of my junior year. I chose NEIT because I loved the school when I first took a tour of it, I also liked how the programs got into their majors right away. My interests aren't a lot and they're super simple but I love finding random movies or shows to watch in my free time, it give me something new to experience watching and give a new genre of things a try. I like playing games as well, one of my favorite games is called "Identity V", it isn't super popular but it's a fun game over all, it is similar to the game Dead By Daylight. I also love finding random music on spotify, I don't have a specific taste for when it comes to music. I enjoy doing photography whenever I go out to a new place, mostly of nature, but I find that it's something relaxing I can do.</p>
