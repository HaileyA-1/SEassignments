                <p>In my opinion, no matter how old I get, <em>How to Train Your Dragon</em> will always be one of my favorite movies to rewatch every year. Though an older movie, it was a movie that gave me a bigger imagination. There are so many scenes that I have enjoyed watching from this movie, there was so many powerful scenes that had great meanings, though you might not notice it at first when watching the movie for the first time.</p>

                <p>One of my favorite characters has to be Hiccup, though common since he is the main character in the movie, he has a large character development that I enjoyed watching. The storyline was something I hadn't seen before and it was a moving I found touching in some ways.</p>
